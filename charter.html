                <h3>Name &amp; Purpose</h3>
                <hr/>
                <h4>Name</h4>
                <p>The name of the gaming clan/guild/community shall be Templar, abbreviated TLR.</p>
                <h4>Purpose</h4>
                <p>Templar is a gaming clan/guild/community with <strong>no other intention other than having fun in life, in game, and in general</strong>. Templar serves as a collaborative environment for gamers of great diversity. There are no limits for Templar, as it is a constantly changing and evolving community while maintaining its core values of <em>respect, integrity and maturity</em>.</p>
                <h3>Meetings</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>Notice of all meetings of Members must be sent at least 5 days in advance. Notice of meetings shall also be posted at the gaming clan/community's website. The leadership may email all members the notice of the meeting to stress the importance of the meeting.</p>
                <h3>Overview &amp; Structure</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>The community of Templar houses several branches within the community that specialize in a particular video game. A branch of Templar is lead by either the Community Leader or a designated Community Officer (detailed in the Community Hierarchy section) who has complete freedom to lead the branch as they please as long as it complies with the community rules.</p>
                <p>There are a total of four community ranks within Templar:</p>
                <Ul>
                    <li>Community Leader</li>
                    <li>Community Officer</li>
                    <li>Community Veteran</li>
                    <li>Community Member</li>
                    <li>Recruit</li>
                </Ul>
                <h4>Branches</h4>
                <p>Each branch has it’s unique hierarchy managed by the branch leader. This unique hierarchy means that all members of the community hold a rank within the Community Hierarchy, as well as a rank within each corresponding branch they actively participate in. If a branch is forced to dissolve due to unfortunate circumstances, court order, or planned dissolution, all members of that branch will lose their rank within the discontinued branch; however they will continue to hold their rank within the community and any other branches they actively participate in.</p>

                            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
                            <p>This rank is awarded to long-term members for their time and dedication to the Templar gaming community. </p>

                        <h4>Community Member</h4>
                        <p>The gaming community recognizes the rights of all members. Templar also recognizes the rights of members to vote in all elections opened to regular members. This includes, but is not limited to the election of the officers. The Member rank is awarded to those who have proven that they are an important contribution to the community.</p>
                        <div class="well">
                            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
                            <p>Completed their probationary period and proved to be an important contribution to the community.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Recruit</h4>
                        <p>Recruit is given to every individual who initially joins Templar. (Unless otherwise sanctioned by the Community Leader and Community Officers) Recruits are expected to follow all the same rules as the rest of the members, but are considered to be in a state of probation which typically lasts 90 days. This period is for the community to observe and see if the individual has proven to be an important contribution to the Community. Since this period is probationary and often given to individuals who have just joined the community, the leadership understands that Templar can be considered overwhelming and therefore the rules are not as strongly enforced but, if you show that you are hazardous to the community, you will be removed without any reason given.</p>
